## Project Description
BookHub is a ReactJS project that provides a platform for users to discover, explore, and connect with the world of books. It offers several features to enhance the user experience:

1. **Support for Editing Row Entries**: Users can edit the details of a book directly within the table.
2. **Search Books by Author**: Easily search for books by author name.
3. **Download Results in CSV**: Users can download the current search results as a CSV file for offline use.
4. **User Authentication**: Secure login and authentication for users.
5. **Pagination Support**: Navigate through pages of book entries efficiently.
6. **Customizable Results Per Page**: By default, 10 books are shown per page, but users can change this to display 50 or 100 records per page.
7. **Sorting Columns**: Ability to apply ascending or descending sort on all columns to organize data as needed.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
